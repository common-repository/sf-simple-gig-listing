Just a simple listing for any events or gigs you want to display on your blog or site.

== Description ==

By adding any gigs or events in your backend using the admin menu "Simple Gig Listing", you can make use of the widget "Show All Gigs" to display them in frontend.

It is also possible to use the Shortcode [sfsgl_show] to display your events or gigs at any point you want.

The Admin menu comes along with three tabs.

The first, "Dashboard", is an overview of all gigs. It displays all inserted gigs and gives you the opportunity to delete any of them. Any gigs marked with grey background color are past gigs.

The second, "Add Gig", is selfexplaining.

In the tab "Settings" are some options to set. E.g. the amount of gigs to display.
